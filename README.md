# EvolutionSimulator
<h1>Simple simulation of evolution.</h1>
<i>(Frequent commits as I program on two places)</i>

<b>So far done :</b>
- Animals are randomly mutating their color, and their breeding chances are bigger if their color is more similar to environment color.
- Environment creates plague, if animalSpecies is too big = weeds out the weak
- Have a map of regions with distinct populations

<b>Goals for first release :</b>

- Different region types require different animal traits to evolve
- Distinct plant types
- Populations can compete with each other, can move to other regions
- Regions can randomly create viruses
- Virus spreading between animals
- Population numbers are limited by food sources (plants/other species)
